# duck_callback_api
Duck Callback API Project is a website that uses the Random Duck API (by: https://random-d.uk/api) to display a random duck image. This is achieved by using a JavaScript callback that executes every time the user refreshes the page. As a result, the website offers a more dynamic and interactive experience, allowing users to obtain different duck images each time they interact with the site. Additionally, the website features a friendly and easy-to-use interface, making navigation and enjoyment of the experience easier. Duck Callback API Project is an excellent choice for those looking for a fun way to learn about the use of callbacks in JavaScript and how they can be used in web application development.
